                    Hello I'm Sam, a passionate Full-Stack Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a recent graduate from Eleven Fifty Academy, where I cultivated my skills in software development and web technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at Eleven Fifty Academy, I delved into coding, gaining proficiency in C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET Framework, SQL, and hands-on experience in Agile and Scrum methodologies. I honed version control using Git, explored APIs, refined skills in MVC architecture, and managed code repositories on GitHub. This experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking for software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I enjoy working out, golfing, and playing video games. With a
                    diverse skill set and a love for learning, I'm committed to making a
                    positive impact wherever I go.
